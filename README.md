First, take some potatoes in a bowl. To spice them up, add chopped coriander, finely chopped green chillies, roughly chopped onion, Red Chilli Masala, Chat Masala and salt to taste, now mash them and get it all together. To make the bread, take some bread slices cut off the edges, dip one side in water and press it to get rid of excess water. Now fill the bread with the stuffing you made earlier. Now heat some oil in a caludron on high flame. After the bread roll gets golden-brown, your monsoon snack is ready to eat and serve!
